             <P font-align="center">
             
                    
Vrikshasana, or Tree Pose, is a balancing posture that encourages steadiness, patience, and inner strength. This pose mimics the grace of a tree: rooted deeply in the earth yet reaching upward toward the sky. Practicing Tree Pose improves concentration, coordination, and posture while toning the legs and strengthening the core. It also fosters a sense of confidence and poise, helping you remain centered both physically and emotionally. Despite its challenges, Tree Pose offers a profound sense of grounding and calm when approached with focus and breath awareness.

             <h2> STEP 1</h2>
             <P font-align="center">Stand tall in Mountain Pose with your feet firmly planted on the ground. Shift your weight slowly onto your left foot, grounding down through the sole while keeping the leg active and strong. Bend your right knee and lift your right foot, placing the sole either on the inner left thigh or the calf (avoid placing it directly on the knee). Use your hand to guide your foot into position if needed. Press your foot firmly into your leg and resist with equal pressure to create a stable connection.</P>
             <h2> STEP 2</h2>
             <P font-align="center">Bring your palms together in front of your heart in prayer position (Anjali Mudra), or slowly raise your arms overhead, keeping your palms facing each other or joined. Lengthen through your spine and lift gently through the crown of your head while keeping your shoulders relaxed. Fix your gaze on a still point in front of you to maintain balance. Stay in the pose for several breaths, feeling the strength and stability of your standing leg. When you're ready, gently lower your foot and repeat on the other side.</P>
