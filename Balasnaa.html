Balasana, or Child’s Pose, is a deeply restorative posture that invites you to pause and reconnect with your breath. It is often used as a resting position in yoga sequences and is especially helpful for reducing stress, fatigue, and anxiety. This pose gently stretches the hips, thighs, and lower back, making it an ideal counterpose to backbends and standing postures. It also encourages introspection, relaxation, and surrender, helping you to cultivate a sense of inner peace and mindfulness.

             <h2> STEP 1</h2>
             <P font-align="center">Begin by kneeling on your mat with your big toes touching and your knees either together or spread apart, depending on what feels most comfortable. Sit your hips back onto your heels, and gently begin to fold your torso forward, allowing your forehead to rest on the mat. If your hips do not easily touch your heels, you can place a cushion or folded blanket between your hips and heels for added support and comfort.</P>
             <h2> STEP 2</h2>
             <P font-align="center">Extend your arms forward on the mat with your palms facing down, keeping the elbows slightly lifted or resting on the ground. Alternatively, you can bring your arms back alongside your body with palms facing upward if that feels more restful. Soften your entire body into the mat and allow your breath to deepen naturally. Stay in this pose for as long as you need, letting go of tension with each exhalation and feeling the gentle release in your spine, shoulders, and hips.</P>
