             <h1> Bhujangasana (Cobra Pose)</h1>
             <P font-align="center">
             
                    Bhujangasana, commonly known as Cobra Pose, is a rejuvenating backbend that opens the chest and strengthens the spine. This pose is excellent for counteracting the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle, such as tight shoulders and slouched posture. It stretches the muscles in the chest, abdomen, and front of the shoulders while simultaneously building strength in the arms and upper back. Cobra Pose also stimulates the digestive organs and can enhance emotional resilience by opening the heart center. It is often included in Sun Salutations or used as a gentle introduction to deeper backbends.

             <h2> STEP 1</h2>
             <P font-align="center">Start by lying flat on your stomach with your legs extended behind you. Position the tops of your feet flat against the mat and let your heels fall naturally outward. Place your hands beneath your shoulders with your fingers spread wide, elbows close to your ribcage and pointing backward. Rest your forehead gently on the mat, and relax your shoulders away from your ears. Take a few breaths here to feel the connection of your body with the floor and to prepare for the pose.</P>
             <h2> STEP 2</h2>
             <P font-align="center">As you inhale, begin to press gently through your palms and lift your head, chest, and upper abdomen off the mat. Keep your elbows slightly bent and tucked in toward your sides. Engage your back muscles more than your arms to lift, avoiding pushing too hard with your hands. Open your chest and keep your shoulders relaxed as you gaze forward or slightly upward. Make sure your pelvis and legs remain in contact with the mat. Stay in the pose for a few breaths, and then exhale to lower yourself back down slowly and with control.</P>
